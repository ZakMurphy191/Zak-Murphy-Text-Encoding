    <poem>
        <lb n="1">Two roads diverged in a <color>yellow</color> wood,</lb>
        <lb n="2">And sorry I could not travel both</lb>
        <lb n="3">And be one traveler, long I stood</lb>
        <lb n="4">looked down one as far as I could</lb>
        <lb n="5">To where it bent in the undergrowth;</lb>

        <lb n="6">Then took the other, as just as fair,</lb>
        <lb n="7">And having perhaps the better claim,</lb>
        <lb n="8">Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</lb>
        <lb n="9">Though as for that the passing there</lb>
        <lb n="10">Had worn them really about the same,</lb>

        <lb n="11">And both that morning equally lay</lb>
        <lb n="12">In leaves no step had trodden black.</lb>
        <lb n="13">Oh, I kept the first for another day!</lb>
        <lb n="14">Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</lb>
        <lb n="15">I doubted if I should ever come back.</lb>

        <lb n="16">I shall be telling this with a sigh</lb>
        <lb n="17">Somewhere ages and ages hence:</lb>
        <lb n="18">Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”</lb>
        <lb n="19">I took the one less traveled by,</lb>
        <lb n="20">And that has made all the difference.</lb>
